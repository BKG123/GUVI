Those informations are the user id the gender the age and the estimated salary. A car company has just launched their brand new luxury SUV. And we're trying to see which of these users of the social network are going to buy this brand new SUV And the last column here tells If yes or no the user bought this SUV we are going to build a model that is going to predict if a user is going to buy or not the SUV based on two variables which are going to be the age and the estimated salary. So our matrix of feature is only going to be these two columns. We want to find some correlations between the age and the estimated salary of a user and his decision to purchase yes or no the
